Magnetic Moments (VASP)
-----------------------

This tutorial shows how to perform global search for optimal magnetic
moments on VASP.

In VASP there are two variables that control the magnetic moments imposed on
atoms and for contrain magnetic moments along predefined directions.

Lets start with one INCAR file that looks like this::

        $SYSTEM   =  CaMnO3 Pnma
        PREC      =  Accurate
        NELMIN    =  6
        NELM      =  100
        EDIFF     =  1E-09
        EDIFFG    = -5E-6
        IBRION    =  1
        ISIF      =  2
        LREAL     = .FALSE.
        ADDGRID   = .TRUE.
        NSW       =  0
        ISMEAR    = -5
        ENCUT     =  500
        ISPIN     =  2
        LORBIT    =  11
        LMAXMIX   =  4
        ISYM      =  0
        LSORBIT   = .TRUE.
        RWIGS     = 2.00 1.87 1.78 1.24 # d-d/2
        SAXIS     = 0 0 1
        LPLANE    = .TRUE.
        NPAR      = 2
        LSCALU    = .FALSE.
        NSIM      = 4
        LWAVE     = .FALSE.
        AMIX      = 0.8
        BMIX      = 0.9
        AMIX_MAG  = 0.4
        BMIX_MAG  = 0.9

        MAGMOM    = 12*0
                    0.0000000 0.0416472 2.3859677
                    0.0000000 0.0416472 -2.3859677
                    0.0000000 0.0416472 -2.3859677
                    0.0000000 0.0416472 2.3859677
                    60*0
        M_CONSTR  = 12*0
                    0.0000000 0.0416472 2.3859677
                    0.0000000 0.0416472 -2.3859677
                    0.0000000 0.0416472 -2.3859677
                    0.0000000 0.0416472 2.3859677
                    60*0
        I_CONSTRAINED_M = 1
        LAMBDA    = 10

        #LDAU      =  .TRUE.
        #LDAUTYPE  =  1
        #LDAUL     =  -1  2 -1
        #LDAUU     =  0.0 4.0 0.0
        #LDAUJ     =  0.0 0.0 0.0
        #LDAUPRINT =  2

We have commented the variables related with LDA+U but the procedure works enabling those variables too.
The variables MAGMOM and M_CONSTR controls the initial direction of Magnetic Moments and the constrained direction using
LAMBDA as a parameter to control the intensity of the contrain.

Now, for different values of MAGMOM you can get variations on the total energy and the optimal magnetization can only
be obtained by covering all possible directions.

The population 'NonCollinearMagMoms' defined the procedures to create a pool of candidates with random directions
for Magnetic Moments and modify their directions in several ways suitable for being used by the global search algorithms
implemented on PyChemia.

On this tutorial we will explore step by step how the methods on 'NonCollinearMagMoms' where implemented and how use
them for efficiently

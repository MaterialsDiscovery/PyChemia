Global Minimization with Metaheuristics
=======================================

One of the first features implemented on PyChemia was the ability to perform global minimization for various purposes
in materials science using a variety of Metaheuristic algorithms. On this set of tutorials, we will demonstrate this
capability in a variety of problems: Searching optimal configurations of Lennard-Jones clusters, finding structures
of binaries and ternaries using several Tight-Binding and DFT codes,  optimizing the Magnetic Moments with VASP and
optimizing the density matrices for DFT+U using ABINIT.

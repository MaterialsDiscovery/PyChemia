        Harmony Search Method:
        This searcher is the simplest one, does not require a metric space except for the evaluation
        of duplicates. It is more elaborated than a simple random search.
        Harmony Search only requires changers for existing members and generation of new random members.

                    members, a value of 1 means never discard any member except those in tail (see below). A value
                    of 0 means always discard except those in tail (see below).
        :param par: Probability of being changed for those not discarded. A value of 1 means always changed, a value
                    of 0 means never changed.

Module with classes for pure periodic systems (Crystals)
There are three main classes on this module: *KPoints* for describing a grid, list or path of points
in reciprocal space. Lattice for storing a manipulating cell vectors and computing the reciprocal lattice.
CrystalSymmetry for computing spacegroups, finding primitives and refining cells.

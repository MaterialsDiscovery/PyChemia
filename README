PyChemia
========

Python Materials Discovery Framework

PyChemia is an open-source Python Library for materials structural
search. The purpose of the initiative is to create a method agnostic
framework for materials discovery and design using a variety of methods
from Minima Hoping to Soft-computing based methods. PyChemia is also a
library for data-mining, using several methods to discover interesting
candidates among the materials already processed.

The core of the library is the Structure python class, it is able to
describe periodic and non-periodic structures. As the focus of this
library is structural search the class defines extensive capabilities to
modify atomic structures.

The library includes capability to read and write in several ab-initio
codes. At the level of DFT, PyChemia support VASP, ABINIT and Octopus.
At Tight-binding level development is in process to support DFTB+ and
Fireball. This allows the library to compute electronic-structure
properties using state-of-the-art ab-initio software packages and
extract properties from those calculations.

Installation
============

You can install pychemia in several ways, using the sources or the packages on pip

Installing with pip from pypi.org on a virtual environment 
----------------------------------------------------------

Create the virtual environment

```bash
virtualenv pychemia_ve
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source pychemia_ve/bin/activate
```

Install pychemia with pip

```bash
pip install pychemia
```

Installing with pip from a cloned repo on a virtual environment
---------------------------------------------------------------

Create the virtual environment

```bash
virtualenv pychemia_ve
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source pychemia_ve/bin/activate
```

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaterialsDiscovery/PyChemia.git
```

Install from the repo folder

```bash
pip install PyChemia
```

Using PyChemia from repo folder on a virtual environment
--------------------------------------------------------

Create the virtual environment

```bash
virtualenv pychemia_ve
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source pychemia_ve/bin/activate
```

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaterialsDiscovery/PyChemia.git
```

Go to repo folder and execute `setup.py` to build the Cython modules.  

```bash
cd PyChemia
pip install Cython
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
python setup.py build
```

Install the packages required for PyChemia to work

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



PyChemia requirements
=====================

Before installing PyChemia, you may need to first install a few critical
dependencies

Mandatory
---------

1.  Python >= 3.6
    The library is tested on Travis for Python 3.6 and 3.7
    Support for Python 2.7 has been removed

    https://travis-ci.org/MaterialsDiscovery/PyChemia

2.  Numpy >= 1.17 NumPy is a fundamental package for any Python
    scientific library. Numpy arrays are essential for efficient array
    manipulation. Many distributions come with relatively old version of
    numpy, so you should install a more recent version.

3.  SciPy >= 1.3 SciPy is used for many linear algebra and FFT calls
    Most distros comes with scipy 0.13 or below. PyChemia uses
    scipy.spatial that have been actively developed since version 0.15,
    we have tested PyChemia on 0.17.

4.  Spglib >= 1.9 Spglib is used to determine symmetry groups for
    structures

5.  Matplotlib >= 3.0 Used to plot band structures, densities of states
    and other 2D plots

6.  PyMongo >= 3.9 At least for structural search PyChemia relies
    strongly in MongoDB and its python driver. For the MongoDB server,
    any version beyond 3.0 should be fine. We have tested pychemia on
    MongoDB 3.2

    pip install pymongo

    or

    pip install pymongo --user

7. PSUtil >= 5.6 Used to get insign about computer load at a given time.

Optional
--------

1.  nose (https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) >= 1.3.7 A python
    library for testing, simply go to the source directory and execute

    nosetests -v

2.  pytest Another utility for testing. 

3.  Pandas Library for Data Analysis used by the datamining modules

4.  PyMC PyMC is a python module that implements Bayesian statistical
    models and fitting algorithms Important for the datamining
    capabilities of PyChemia

5.  Mayavi >= 4.1 Some basic visualization tools are incorporated using
    this library

6.  ScientificPython >2.6 This library is used for reading and writing
    NetCDF files

7.  pymatgen >= 2.9 pymatgen is an excellent library for materials
    analysis

8.  ASE Atomic Simulation Environment is another good library for
    ab-initio calculations. Quite impressive for the number of ab-initio
    packages supported

9.  qmpy The Python library behind the Open Quantum Materials Database.
    The OQMD is a database of DFT calculated structures. For the time
    being the database contains more than 300000 structures, with more
    than 90% of them with the electronic ground-state computed.

10.  [coverage] (https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy) >= 4.0.1 Provides
    code coverage analysis

11.  python-coveralls To submit coverage information to coveralls.io

    https://coveralls.io/github/MaterialsDiscovery/PyChemia

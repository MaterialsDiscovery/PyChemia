PyChemia, Python Framework for Materials Discovery and Design
=============================================================

![PyChemia](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaterialsDiscovery/PyChemia/master/docs/_static/PyChemia_Small.png)

PyChemia is an open-source Python Library for materials structural
search. The purpose of the initiative is to create a method agnostic
framework for materials discovery and design using a variety of methods
from Minima Hoping to Soft-computing based methods. PyChemia is also a
library for data-mining, using several methods to discover interesting
candidates among the materials already processed.

The core of the library is the Structure python class, it is able to
describe periodic and non-periodic structures. As the focus of this
library is structural search the class defines extensive capabilities to
modify atomic structures.

The library includes capability to read and write in several ab-initio
codes. At the level of DFT, PyChemia support VASP, ABINIT and Octopus.
At Tight-binding level development is in process to support DFTB+ and
Fireball. This allows the library to compute electronic-structure
properties using state-of-the-art ab-initio software packages and
extract properties from those calculations.

Installation
============

You can install pychemia in several ways. We are showing 3 ways of
installing PyChemia inside a Virtual environment. A virtual environment
is a good way of isolating software packages from the pacakges installed
with the Operating System. The decision on which method to use
depends if you want to use the most recent code or the package uploaded
from time to time to PyPi. The last method is particularly suited for
developers who want to change the code and get those changes operative without
an explicit instalation.


Installing with pip from pypi.org on a virtual environment 
----------------------------------------------------------

This method installs PyChemia from the packages uploaded
to PyPi every month. It will provides a version of 
PyChemia that is stable.

First, create and activate the virtual environment.
We are using the name `pychemia_ve`, but that is arbitrary.

```bash
virtualenv pychemia_ve
source pychemia_ve/bin/activate
```

When the virtual environment is activated, your prompt 
changes to `(pychemia_ve)...$`. Now, install pychemia 
with pip

```bash
python3 -m pip install pychemia
```

Installing with pip from a cloned repo on a virtual environment
---------------------------------------------------------------

This method installs PyChemia from the Github repo.
The method will install PyChemia from the most recent sources.

First, create and activate the virtual environment.
We are using the name `pychemia_ve`, but that is arbitrary.

```bash
virtualenv pychemia_ve
source pychemia_ve/bin/activate
```

Second, clone the repository from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaterialsDiscovery/PyChemia.git
```

Finally, install from the repo folder

```bash
python3 -m pip install PyChemia
```

Using PyChemia from repo folder on a virtual environment
--------------------------------------------------------

This method is mostly used for development. 
In this way PyChemia is not actually installed and changes to the code
will take inmediate effect.

First, create and activate the virtual environment.
We are using the name `pychemia_ve`, but that is arbitrary.
 
```bash
virtualenv pychemia_ve
source pychemia_ve/bin/activate
```

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaterialsDiscovery/PyChemia.git
```

Go to repo folder, install Cython with pip and 
execute `setup.py` to build the Cython modules.  

```bash
cd PyChemia
python3 -m pip install Cython
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
python3 setup.py build
```

Finally, install the packages required for PyChemia to work

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the variable $PYTHONPATH to point to PyChemia folder, in the case of bash it will be:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=`path`
```

On C shell (csh or tcsh)

```csh
setenv PYTHONPATH `path`
```

PyChemia requirements
=====================

PyChemia relies on a number of other python packages to 
operate. Some of them are mandatory and they must be installed.
Other packages are optional and their absence will only constrain
certain capabilities. 

Mandatory
---------

1.  Python >= 3.6
    The library is tested on Travis for Python 3.6 up to 3.9
    Support for Python 2.7 has been removed

    https://travis-ci.org/MaterialsDiscovery/PyChemia

2.  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/ "Numpy") >= 1.19
    Fundamental library for numerical intensive computation in Python.
    Numpy arrays are essential for efficient array manipulation. 

3.  [SciPy](http://scipy.org/ "SciPy") >= 1.5
    Used mostly for Linear Algebra, FFT and spatial routines.

4.  [Spglib](http://spglib.sourceforge.net/) >= 1.9
    Used to determine symmetry groups for periodic structures

5.  [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/  "Matplotlib") >= 3.3
    Used to plot band structures, densities of states and other 2D plots

6.  [PyMongo](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/) >= 3.11
    Used for structural search PyChemia relies strongly in MongoDB and its python driver. 
    For the MongoDB server, any version beyond 3.11 should be fine. 
    We have tested pychemia on MongoDB 4.0

7.  [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) >= 5.8
    Cross-platform lib for process and system monitoring in Python

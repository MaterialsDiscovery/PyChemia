#Definition of the atom types
ntypat 1          # There is only one type of atom
znucl 13          # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the
                  # possible type(s) of atom. The pseudopotential(s)
                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
                  # to the type(s) of atom. Here, the only type is Aluminum


#Definition of the atoms
natom 1           # There is only one atom per cell
typat 1           # This atom is of type 1, that is, Aluminum
xred              # This keyword indicate that the location of the atoms
                  # will follow, one triplet of number for each atom
   0.0  0.0  0.0     # Triplet giving the REDUCED coordinate of atom 1.

#Definition of the planewave basis set
ecut  6.0         # Maximal kinetic energy cut-off, in Hartree

#Definition of the k-point grid
ngkpt 2 2 2       # This is a 2x2x2 FCC grid, based on the primitive vectors
nshiftk 4         # of the reciprocal space. For a FCC real space lattice,
                  # like the present one, it actually corresponds to the
                  # so-called 4x4x4 Monkhorst-Pack grid, if the following shifts
                  # are used :
shiftk 0.5 0.5 0.5
       0.5 0.0 0.0
       0.0 0.5 0.0
       0.0 0.0 0.5

#Definition of the SCF procedure
nstep 10          # Maximal number of SCF cycles
toldfe 1.0d-6     # Will stop when, twice in a row, the difference
                  # between two consecutive evaluations of total energy
                  # differ by less than toldfe (in Hartree)
                  # This value is way too large for most realistic studies of materials
